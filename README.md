# Freedom Machine-mode Execution Environment

The standard RISC-V software stack defines machine-mode software as
running in a machine-mode execution environment, also known as an MEE.
This repository provides a MEE that is designed to run on SiFive's
Freedom platform devices.  As the MEE runs at machine mode it's not
designed with binary compatibility in mind but is instead tailored to a
specific machine.
